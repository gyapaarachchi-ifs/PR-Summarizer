# Research: AI-Powered PR Summarizer

**Feature**: AI-Powered PR Summarizer  
**Phase**: 0 - Research & Technology Decisions  
**Date**: 2025-10-13

## Overview

This document consolidates research findings for technology choices, integration patterns, and best practices for building an AI-powered PR summarization tool using Python, FastAPI, and Google Gemini.

## Technology Decisions

### 1. Web Framework Selection

**Decision**: FastAPI  
**Rationale**: 
- Native async/await support for concurrent API calls to external services
- Automatic OpenAPI documentation generation for API contracts
- Built-in request/response validation with Pydantic models
- High performance comparable to Node.js and Go
- Excellent type hint integration aligns with constitution requirements

**Alternatives considered**:
- Django: Too heavyweight for API-only backend, lacks native async support
- Flask: Requires additional libraries for async, validation, and documentation

### 2. External Service Integration Libraries

**Decision**: 
- GitHub: `PyGithub` + `httpx` for async operations
- Jira: `jira` library + custom async wrapper
- Confluence: `atlassian-python-api` + async modifications  
- Google Docs: `google-api-python-client` with async executor
- Gemini: `google-generativeai` SDK

**Rationale**: Official and well-maintained libraries with active communities, avoiding custom HTTP client implementations for complex authentication flows.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Pure httpx/aiohttp: Would require implementing OAuth flows and API pagination manually
- Third-party unified libraries: Often outdated or missing features

### 3. Async Processing Strategy

**Decision**: asyncio with structured concurrency using `asyncio.gather()` for parallel data fetching  
**Rationale**: 
- Enables concurrent calls to GitHub, Jira, Confluence, and Google Docs
- Reduces total processing time from sequential ~20s to parallel ~8s
- FastAPI native support for async request handlers

**Implementation pattern**:
```python
async def gather_context(pr_url: str, jira_id: str) -> IntegrationContext:
    github_task = fetch_github_data(pr_url)
    jira_task = fetch_jira_data(jira_id)
    confluence_task = fetch_confluence_docs(jira_id)
    gdocs_task = fetch_google_docs(jira_id)
    
    results = await asyncio.gather(
        github_task, jira_task, confluence_task, gdocs_task,
        return_exceptions=True
    )
    return IntegrationContext.from_results(results)
```

### 4. Error Handling and Resilience

**Decision**: Circuit breaker pattern with graceful degradation  
**Rationale**: External services may be unavailable; system should continue with partial data rather than failing completely.

**Implementation approach**:
- Each service integration wrapped in try/catch with specific exception handling
- Fallback responses when services are unavailable
- Structured error logging for debugging while maintaining user experience

### 5. Configuration Management

**Decision**: Pydantic Settings with environment variable support  
**Rationale**: Type-safe configuration loading, validation, and IDE support aligns with constitution quality standards.

**Configuration structure**:
```python
class Settings(BaseSettings):
    github_token: str
    jira_url: str
    jira_username: str
    jira_api_token: str
    confluence_url: str
    confluence_token: str
    google_credentials_path: str
    gemini_api_key: str
    log_level: str = "INFO"
    max_concurrent_requests: int = 10
```

## Integration Patterns

### 1. GitHub API Integration

**Pattern**: Repository + Service pattern  
**Key considerations**:
- Rate limiting: 5000 requests/hour for authenticated users
- Pagination for large PR diffs
- Webhook validation for real-time updates (future enhancement)

**Data extraction**:
- PR metadata: title, description, author, reviewers
- File changes: added/modified/deleted files with diff content
- Commit messages and linked issues

### 2. Jira API Integration

**Pattern**: Ticket resolution with link following  
**Key considerations**:
- Authentication via API tokens (more secure than passwords)
- Custom field handling for different Jira configurations
- Link traversal to find related tickets and epics

**Data extraction**:
- Ticket details: summary, description, acceptance criteria
- Related tickets via issue links
- Epic and sprint information for broader context

### 3. Confluence Integration

**Pattern**: Search-based content discovery  
**Key considerations**:
- CQL (Confluence Query Language) for targeted searches
- Content extraction from various page formats
- Version handling for document updates

**Search strategy**:
- Search by Jira ticket ID in page content
- Search by project/component keywords
- Extract relevant sections rather than full pages

### 4. Google Docs Integration

**Pattern**: Drive API + Docs API combination  
**Key considerations**:
- OAuth 2.0 authentication flow
- Document discovery via shared drive search
- Content extraction with formatting preservation

**Discovery approach**:
- Search shared drives for documents containing Jira ticket references
- Filter by document type and modification date
- Extract structured content (headings, lists, tables)

### 5. Gemini LLM Integration

**Pattern**: Structured prompt engineering with response validation  
**Key considerations**:
- Token limits: Gemini 2.5 Pro supports up to 2M tokens
- Cost optimization through efficient prompt design
- Response parsing and validation

**Prompt structure**:
```
Context Sources:
[GitHub PR Data]
[Jira Ticket Data]
[Confluence Documentation]
[Google Docs Content]

Task: Generate a structured summary with these exact sections:
1. Business Context
2. Code Change Summary
3. Business/Code Impact
4. Suggested Test Cases
5. Risk & Complexity
6. Reviewer Guidance

Requirements:
- Each section must be 2-4 sentences
- Focus on actionable insights for code reviewers
- Include specific file names and business justifications
```

## Performance Optimization

### 1. Concurrent Processing

**Strategy**: Parallel data fetching with timeout controls  
**Implementation**: 
- 30-second total timeout with 8-second timeout per service
- Graceful handling of partial failures
- Connection pooling for HTTP clients

### 2. Memory Management

**Strategy**: Streaming and chunked processing  
**Considerations**:
- Large PR diffs processed in chunks
- Document content filtered before LLM processing
- Temporary data cleanup after summary generation

### 3. Caching Strategy

**Initial approach**: No caching (simplicity)  
**Future enhancement**: Redis-based caching for:
- GitHub repository metadata
- Jira project configurations
- Confluence space structures

## Security Considerations

### 1. Credential Management

**Pattern**: Environment-based secrets with rotation support  
**Implementation**:
- API tokens stored in environment variables
- No hardcoded credentials in source code
- Support for credential rotation without service restart

### 2. Input Validation

**Strategy**: Multi-layer validation  
**Layers**:
- URL format validation for GitHub PRs
- Jira ticket ID format validation
- Authentication token validation
- Content size limits for LLM processing

### 3. Data Privacy

**Approach**: Minimal data retention  
**Principles**:
- No permanent storage of PR content or summaries
- Logging excludes sensitive business information
- Configurable data retention periods for debugging logs

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Unit Testing

**Framework**: pytest with async support  
**Coverage targets**:
- Service classes: 90% coverage
- Model validation: 100% coverage
- Utility functions: 95% coverage

**Mock strategy**:
- External API responses mocked for consistent testing
- Test data fixtures for various PR and ticket scenarios

### 2. Integration Testing

**Approach**: Test containers with real service integrations  
**Coverage**:
- End-to-end API workflows
- Error handling scenarios
- Performance under load

### 3. Contract Testing

**Pattern**: OpenAPI specification validation  
**Implementation**:
- Generated client tests from OpenAPI specs
- Response schema validation
- API versioning compatibility tests

## Deployment Considerations

### 1. Containerization

**Strategy**: Multi-stage Docker builds  
**Benefits**:
- Consistent development and production environments
- Optimized image sizes with separate build/runtime stages
- Easy scaling with container orchestration

### 2. Environment Configuration

**Approach**: 12-factor app principles  
**Configuration management**:
- Environment-specific settings via environment variables
- Configuration validation on startup
- Health check endpoints for monitoring

## Risk Mitigation

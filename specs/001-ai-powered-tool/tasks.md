# Tasks: AI-Powered PR Summarizer

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-ai-powered-tool/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Test tasks are included per constitutional TDD requirements. Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Web app**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/`
- Paths follow the structure defined in plan.md

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [x] T001 Create project directory structure per implementation plan (backend/, frontend/, config/, tests/)
- [x] T002 Initialize Python project with FastAPI dependencies in backend/requirements.txt
- [x] T003 [P] Configure development dependencies in backend/requirements-dev.txt (pytest, black, mypy, flake8, pytest-cov)
- [x] T004 [P] Create environment configuration template in config/.env.example
- [x] T005 [P] Setup Docker development environment in config/docker-compose.yml
- [x] T006 [P] Configure Python linting and formatting tools (black, mypy, flake8) in backend/pyproject.toml
- [x] T007 [P] Setup pytest configuration in backend/pytest.ini
- [x] T008 [P] Create frontend package.json with React dependencies

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-5)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Polish (Phase 6)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Extends US1 but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Extends US1/US2 but independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Tests (included) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Models before services (data structures before logic)
- Services before API endpoints (business logic before interfaces)
- Backend before frontend (API before UI)
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Contract test for POST /summary endpoint in backend/tests/contract/test_summary_api.py"
Task: "Unit test for SummaryRequest model validation in backend/tests/unit/test_summary_models.py"
Task: "Unit test for GitHub service in backend/tests/unit/test_github_service.py"
Task: "Unit test for Jira service in backend/tests/unit/test_jira_service.py"
Task: "Unit test for Gemini service in backend/tests/unit/test_gemini_service.py"

# Launch all models for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create SummaryRequest model in backend/src/models/request.py"
Task: "Create PRSummary and SummarySection models in backend/src/models/summary.py"

# Launch frontend components in parallel:
Task: "Create InputForm component in frontend/src/components/InputForm.js"
Task: "Create SummaryDisplay component in frontend/src/components/SummaryDisplay.js"
Task: "Create API service client in frontend/src/services/api.js"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Tests ‚Üí Models ‚Üí Services ‚Üí API ‚Üí Frontend)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Tests ‚Üí Services ‚Üí Integration)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Tests ‚Üí Analytics ‚Üí Advanced Features)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Task Summary

**Total Tasks**: 69 tasks across 6 phases
**Task Count by User Story**:
- Setup: 8 tasks
- Foundational: 11 tasks 
- User Story 1: 19 tasks (6 tests + 13 implementation)
- User Story 2: 10 tasks (3 tests + 7 implementation)
- User Story 3: 9 tasks (3 tests + 6 implementation)
- Polish: 12 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities**: 31 tasks marked [P] for parallel execution
**Independent Test Criteria**: Each user story has specific test scenarios for validation
**Suggested MVP Scope**: User Story 1 only (Basic PR Summary Generation)

**Constitutional Compliance**: 
- TDD approach with tests before implementation ‚úÖ
- 80% coverage target with comprehensive test suite ‚úÖ
- Type hints and docstrings required for all components ‚úÖ
- Performance targets validated through dedicated test tasks ‚úÖ
- Structured logging and monitoring built into all services ‚úÖ

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence

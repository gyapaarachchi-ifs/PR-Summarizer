# Feature Specification: AI-Powered PR Summarizer

**Feature Branch**: `001-ai-powered-tool`  
**Created**: 2025-10-13  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "AI-powered tool designed to automatically generate comprehensive summaries for software development pull requests (PRs). Through a web application it takes a jira ticket and the github PR details. When clicked ok, It acts as an intelligent assistant for code reviewers by gathering context from multiple sources, feeding it to a Large Language Model (LLM), and then presenting a structured, easy-to-digest summary. The primary goal is to accelerate the code review process by providing reviewers with all the necessary business and technical context in one place."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Basic PR Summary Generation (Priority: P1)

A code reviewer wants to quickly understand what a PR contains and why it was created. They input a GitHub PR URL and Jira ticket ID, click "Generate Summary," and receive a comprehensive AI-generated summary that explains the business context, code changes, and review guidance.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition - without this basic functionality, the tool provides no value to users.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by providing a valid PR URL and Jira ticket, generating a summary, and verifying all six required sections are populated with relevant information.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has a valid GitHub PR URL and Jira ticket ID, **When** they enter both and click "Generate Summary," **Then** the system displays a structured summary with all six sections populated
2. **Given** a user submits valid inputs, **When** the AI processing completes, **Then** the summary appears as readable text within 30 seconds
3. **Given** a PR with associated code changes, **When** summary is generated, **Then** the "Code Change Summary" section accurately describes what files were modified

### User Story 2 - Multi-Source Context Integration (Priority: P2)

A reviewer needs comprehensive context beyond just the PR and ticket. The system automatically fetches related business documentation from Confluence and Google Docs to provide complete business context in the summary.

**Why this priority**: Enhanced context dramatically improves review quality by connecting technical changes to business requirements.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by verifying that summaries include information not present in just the PR or Jira ticket, but found in connected Confluence/Google Docs.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a Jira ticket references Confluence documentation, **When** generating a summary, **Then** relevant business context from Confluence appears in the "Business Context" section
2. **Given** related Google Docs exist for the feature, **When** the system processes the request, **Then** additional business knowledge is incorporated into the summary

### User Story 3 - Advanced Review Guidance (Priority: P3)

Experienced reviewers want detailed guidance on high-risk areas and specific testing recommendations. The system analyzes code complexity and change patterns to provide targeted reviewer guidance and suggested test cases.

**Why this priority**: This transforms the tool from a basic summarizer to an intelligent review assistant that improves review effectiveness.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by verifying that complex PRs receive more detailed risk assessments and that test case suggestions are relevant to the actual code changes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a PR with high complexity changes, **When** generating a summary, **Then** the "Risk & Complexity" section identifies specific risk factors and provides detailed guidance
2. **Given** a PR modifying critical business logic, **When** the summary is generated, **Then** "Suggested Test Cases" includes specific scenarios relevant to the changed functionality

### Edge Cases

- What happens when GitHub PR is private or inaccessible?
- How does system handle Jira tickets with insufficient information?
- What occurs when Confluence/Google Docs are unavailable or return no relevant content?
- How does the system behave when LLM service is temporarily unavailable?
- What happens when PR contains no code changes (documentation-only)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

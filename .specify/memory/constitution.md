# PR Summarizer Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality Standards (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All code MUST follow strict quality standards: Type hints required for Python code; Docstrings mandatory for all public functions and classes; Code coverage MUST be minimum 80% for new features; Static analysis tools (linting, formatting) MUST pass before merge.

**Rationale**: AI-powered systems require high reliability and maintainability due to complex data flows and model interactions.

### II. Test-First Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
TDD is mandatory: Tests written → User approved → Tests fail → Then implement; Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced; Unit tests for all business logic; Integration tests for AI model interactions and external API calls.

**Rationale**: AgenticRAG systems involve complex AI workflows that must be verified through comprehensive testing to ensure consistent behavior.

### III. User Experience Consistency
All user interfaces MUST provide consistent experience: API responses follow standardized format; Error messages are user-friendly and actionable; Response times are predictable and documented; Graceful degradation when AI services are unavailable.

**Rationale**: Users depend on reliable PR summarization; inconsistent behavior erodes trust in AI-generated content.

### IV. Performance Requirements
System MUST meet strict performance criteria: PR analysis completes within 30 seconds for typical PRs (<1000 lines); API responses under 5 seconds for 95th percentile; Memory usage capped at 2GB per analysis session; Concurrent processing of up to 10 PRs without degradation.

**Rationale**: Developer productivity depends on fast feedback; slow AI tools become adoption barriers.

### V. Observability and Monitoring
All operations MUST be observable: Structured logging for all AI model calls; Performance metrics tracked and alerted; Error rates monitored with automated alerts; Request tracing through the entire pipeline; Model prediction confidence logged.

**Rationale**: AI systems require deep observability to debug model behavior, track performance, and ensure reliability.

## Performance Standards

System MUST maintain the following performance benchmarks:
- **Latency**: 95th percentile response time under 5 seconds for API calls
- **Throughput**: Handle minimum 100 PR analyses per hour
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime during business hours
- **Resource Usage**: Maximum 2GB RAM per analysis, 4 CPU cores peak
- **Model Performance**: Summarization accuracy validated through user feedback (target: 85% satisfaction)

## Quality Gates

All code changes MUST pass these gates before deployment:
- **Static Analysis**: Linting, type checking, security scanning pass
- **Test Coverage**: Minimum 80% code coverage, all critical paths tested
- **Performance Tests**: Load testing confirms latency requirements
- **AI Model Validation**: Model outputs reviewed for quality and bias
- **Documentation**: README, API docs, and inline documentation updated
- **Security Review**: All external integrations and data handling reviewed

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices. Amendments require:
1. Documented rationale for change
2. Impact assessment on existing features
3. Migration plan for affected components
4. Team approval through PR review process

All PRs and code reviews MUST verify constitutional compliance. Complexity that violates these principles MUST be justified with specific technical rationale. Exceptions require explicit documentation and timeline for remediation.
